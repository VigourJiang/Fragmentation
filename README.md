# Fragmentation
A project illustrating the general use of Fragments in Android programming. This version uses new methods in the API and is restricted to API 23 or greater.  A version converted from Eclipse to Android Studio that runs on APIs back to 15 may be found at https://github.com/guidrymwg/Fragmentation2.

The projects in these repositories correspond to individual lessons in the free online android programming course at http://eagle.phys.utk.edu/guidry/android/
